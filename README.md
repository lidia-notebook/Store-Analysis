# MAJU JAYA DIGITAL— Sales & Customer Data Analysis

##  Project Overview
This project focuses on transforming raw transactional and customer data from **Maju Jaya Digital** into structured, analysis-ready datasets. The main goal is to support **data-driven decision making** that helps the business improve performance, reduce risk, and grow sustainably.

As many businesses fail not because of lack of effort, but due to poor strategic decisions, this project positions data as a **strategic asset**, not just an operational byproduct.

## Business Context

Multiple global studies show that **around 50% of businesses fail before reaching their 4th–5th year**:

- According to the **U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA)**, only **about 50% of businesses survive beyond five years**.
- This means **1 out of 2 businesses fail in the medium term**, often due to:
  - Poor understanding of customers
  - Ineffective pricing & discount strategies
  - Weak cash flow visibility
  - Decisions not backed by data
